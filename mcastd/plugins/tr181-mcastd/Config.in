	  If set, the plugin runs an extra NeMo query for an IPTV WAN
	  interface to find out which interface below that IPTV WAN interface
	  has the flag mcast-iptv. Set this option if the IPTV WAN interface
	  is a bridge, and the MCASTD accelerator should only create an
	  acceleration rule for the interface in the bridge which has the
	  mcast-iptv flag set. The plugin passes the result from the NeMo
	  query to kernel space.
	  This option is added for following use case. Some projects put 2
	  interfaces in the IPTV WAN bridge, one with the flag mcast-iptv, and
	  one with the flag vod-iptv. But the vod-iptv interface is for VOD
	  which is unicast. So there's no reason to create a MC acceleration
	  rule for the vod-iptv interface.
